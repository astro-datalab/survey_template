<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) is using DECam to map
480 square degrees of sky to depths of ugriz~24 with the goal of identifying
broadly distributed, low surface brightness stellar populations associated
with the stellar halos and tidal debris of the Magellanic Clouds. It will
eventually contain measurements of approximately 250 million objects
distributed in discrete fields spanning an area of about 2400 square degrees.
The first data release (DR1) contains ~100 million objects from 61 observed
fields. Browse these pages to learn more about SMASH and to access the data.
The SMASH overview paper (Nidever et al. 2017) describes the survey in
detail, including its goals, survey strategy, reduction, and calibration.
