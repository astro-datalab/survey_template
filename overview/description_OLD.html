<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a 5000 square degree grizY survey of the Southern sky aimed at understanding the accelerating expansion rate of the Universe.  DES is using four complementary methods to do this: weak gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster counts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae. DES uses the 3 square degree Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 570 Megapixel CCD imaging camera installed at the prime focus of on the Blanco 4m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in northern Chile.  The survey is being performed over a period of five years (2013-2018), and is recording information from roughly 300 million distant galaxies and 100 million Milky Way stars.  DES is also pursuing a time domain survey over a 30 square degree area aimed at discovery of thousands of supernova and other transients.

<p>The Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) is using DECam to map
480 square degrees of sky to depths of ugriz~24 with the goal of identifying
broadly distributed, low surface brightness stellar populations associated
with the stellar halos and tidal debris of the Magellanic Clouds. It will
eventually contain measurements of approximately 250 million objects
distributed in discrete fields spanning an area of about 2400 square degrees.
The first data release (DR1) contains ~100 million objects from 61 observed
fields. Browse these pages to learn more about SMASH and to access the data.
The SMASH overview paper (Nidever et al. 2017) describes the survey in
detail, including its goals, survey strategy, reduction, and calibration.
