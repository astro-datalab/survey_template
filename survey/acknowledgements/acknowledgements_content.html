    <p>The unWISE coadded images and catalog are based on data products from the
      Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, which is a joint project of the University of
      California, Los Angeles, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of
      Technology, and NEOWISE, which is a project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California
      Institute of Technology. WISE and NEOWISE are funded by the National Aeronautics and
      Space Administration.
    </p>
    <p>The unWISE Catalog analysis was run on the Odyssey cluster supported by the FAS Division
      of Science, Research Computing Group at Harvard University, and on the National Energy
      Research Scientific Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported
      by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.
      The unWISE nebulosity CNN was trained on the XStream computational resource,
      supported by the National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation program (ACI-1429830).
    </p>
    <p>Generating the unWISE catalog included use of the HyperLeda database (http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr).
    </p>
    <p>Database access and other data services are hosted by the Astro Data Lab at the Community Science and
      Data Center (CSDC) of the National Science Foundation's National Optical Infrared Astronomy
      Research Laboratory, operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA)
      under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.
