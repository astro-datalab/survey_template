  </header>

<p>The DELVE DR1 data are accessible by a variety of means:</p>

<p>
<b>Data Lab Table Access Protocol (TAP) service</b>
<p>TAP provides a convenient access layer to the DELVE DR1 catalog database.
TAP-aware clients (such as <a
href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>) can point to
<i>http://datalab.noao.edu/tap</i>, select the <i>delve_dr1</i> database, and
see the database tables and descriptions. <i>delve_dr1</i> contains a
table named <i>objects</i>, which is described in the Data Lab 
<a href="https://datalab.noao.edu/query.php?name=delve_dr1.objects">table browser</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>Data Lab Query Manager</b>
<p>The Query Manager is available as part of the Data Lab software
distribution.  The Query Manager client provides a Python API to Data Lab
database services.  These services include 
anonymous access through synchronous queries of the catalog made directly to
the database as well as authenticated access, 
asynchronous queries, personal database storage, and storage
through the Data Lab VOSpace.</p>

<p>
<b>Image Cutouts</b>
<p>
The Data Lab Simple Image Access (SIA) service provides a fast way to retrieve cutouts from DELVE images processed with the DECam Community Pipeline (<a href="">Valdes et al. 2014</a>). For an example of how to use the SIA service, see this Jupyter notebook.
</p>
<p> 
<b>Jupyter Notebook Server</b>
<p>The Data Lab <a href="http://datalab.noao.edu/devbooks">Jupyter Notebook
  server</a> (user authenticated service) contains examples of how to access
  and visualize the DELVE DR1 catalog.
