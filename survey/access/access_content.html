      <h2>Data Access</h2>
  </header>

<p>The NSC DR2 data are accessible by a variety of means:</p>
  
<b>Data Lab Table Access Protocol (TAP) service</b>
<p>TAP provides a convenient access layer to the NSC catalog database.
TAP-aware clients (such as <a
href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">TOPCAT</a>) can point to
<i>https://datalab.noao.edu/tap</i>, select the <i>nsc_dr2</i> database, and
see the database tables and descriptions.  <i>nsc_dr2</i> contains five
tables: <i>chip, exposure, coverage, object,</i> and <i>measurement</i>.

<p>
<b>Data Lab Query Manager</b><br>
The Query Manager is available as part of the Data Lab software
distribution.  The Query Manager client provides a Python API to Data Lab
database services.  Services include authenticated access, synchronous and
asynchronous queries, TAP queries, personal database storage, and storage
through the Data Lab VOSpace.

<p> 
  <b>Image cutouts</b><br>
The Data Lab Simple Image Access (SIA) service provides a fast way
  to retrieve cutouts from NSC images. This service will be available for
  NSC DR2 in the near future.

<p> 
  <b>Jupyter Notebook Server</b><br>
The Data Lab <a href="http://datalab.noao.edu/devbooks">Jupyter Notebook
server</a> contains examples of how to access and visualize the NSC
catalog.
