  DELVE seeks to understand the faintest and most dark-matter-dominated galaxies in a range of environments.
  The DELVE data enable the detection and characterization of dwarf galaxies over a broad range of luminosity, from the ultra-faint satellites of the Milky Way (L ~ 10<sup>3</sup>L<sub>&#8857;</sub>), to the Magellanic Clouds (L ~ 10<sup>9−10</sup>L<sub>&#8857;</sub>), and analogs of the Magellanic Clouds in the Local Volume.
  DELVE consists of:
  <ul>
    <li> <b>DELVE-WIDE:</b> a high-Galactic-latitude wide-area survey of 10,500 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of g,r,i,z ~ 23.5 mag. </li>
    <li> <b>DELVE-MC:</b> a contiguous Magellanic Cloud periphery survey of 1,050 deg<sup>2</sup> at a depth of g,r,i ~ 24.5 mag. </li>
    <li> <b>DELVE-DEEP:</b> a deep targeted survey of 150 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of g,i ~ 25.5 mag around four isolated Local Volume dwarf galaxies.</li>
  </ul>
  These three survey components will provide complementary insights into the abundance and properties of satellite galaxies around hosts at different mass scales and in a variety of environments. 
  Combined with a unified theoretical framework, DELVE will explore  the dependence of satellite properties on effects of reionization, host halo properties, and environment, offering essential insights into the galaxy–halo connection.
