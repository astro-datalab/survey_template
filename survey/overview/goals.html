The primary goal of the Dark Energy Survey is to measure the cosmic acceleration of the Universe with high precision.  It does this with four complementary cosmological probes:

<ul>
    <li><b>Supernovae</b>.
      DES observes a 27 square degree area, distributed over several fields, with a weekly cadence aimed at discovering thousands of supernovae for use for cosmology.
    </li>
    <li><b>Weak gravitational lensing</b>.
      DES measures the total matter content and structure of the Universe via the weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies.
    </li>
    <li><b>Galaxy clusters</b>.
      DES detects tens of thousands of galaxy clusters, the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the Universe.</li>
    <li><b>Galaxy clustering</b>.
      DES measures the spatial distribuiton of galaxies which is a sensitive probe of large-scale structure and the primordial distribution of matter.</li>
</ul>

The DES data enable many other exciting scientific studies, which can be explored through the DES public data releases.
