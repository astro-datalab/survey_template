  DELVE seeks to understand the faintest and most dark-matter-dominated galaxies in a range of environments.
  The DELVE data enable the detection and characterization of dwarf galaxies over a broad range of luminosity, from the ultra-faint satellites of the Milky Way (L ~ 10<sup>3</sup>L<sub>&#8857;</sub>), to the Magellanic Clouds (L ~ 10<sup>9−10</sup>L<sub>&#8857;</sub>), and analogs of the Magellanic Clouds in the Local Volume.
  DELVE consists of:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>DELVE-WIDE:</b> a high-Galactic-latitude wide-area survey focused on resolved stellar systems (e.g., ultra-faint satellite galaxies and stellar streams) in the Milky Way halo. </li>
    <li> <b>DELVE-MC:</b> a contiguous Magellanic Cloud periphery survey to study the structure, evolution, star formation history, and satellite population of the Magellanic Clouds.</li>
    <li> <b>DELVE-DEEP:</b> a deep targeted survey of four Magellanic Cloud analogs (Sextans B, NGC 55, NGC 300, IC 5152) in the Local Volume to study the satellite populations of isolated low-mass hosts.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  These three survey components will provide complementary insights into the abundance and properties of satellite galaxies around hosts at different mass scales and in a variety of environments. 
  Combined with a unified theoretical framework, DELVE will explore  the dependence of satellite properties on effects of reionization, host halo properties, and environment, offering essential insights into the galaxy–halo connection.
