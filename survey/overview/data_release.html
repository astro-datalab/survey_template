    <h2>First Data Release (DR1)</h2>
</header>
The figure below shows the density of the 2.9 billion objects in the NSC DR1 catalog covering ~30,000 square degrees.
There are 34 billion measurements from 255 thousand exposures.  Access and exploration tools include the Data Lab
<a href="http://datalab.noao.edu/discovery.php">Data Discovery tool</a>, database access to the catalog (via
direct query or TAP service), an image cutout service, and a Jupyter notebook server with
<a href="analysis.php">example notebooks</a> for exploratory analysis.

There are six NSC DR1 tables in the database:
<ul>
    <li><b>Coverage</b>.
      Coverage information for each nside=4096 healpix pixel with a resolution of ~1 arcmin.  This gives coverage
      fraction and depth for each band.  201,326,592 rows.
    </li>
    <li><b>Chip</b>.
        Information for each unique chip image with astrometric correction terms and uncertainties. 12,008,634 rows.
    </li>
    <li><b>Exposure</b>.
        Information for each unique exposure with zero-point values and uncertainties. 255,454 rows.
    </li>
    <li><b>Object</b>.
        Information on each unique object with average photometric and astrometric values. 2,930,644,736 rows.
    </li>
    <li><b>Crossmatch</b>.
      Crossmatch information between the NSC and other large catalogs. <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Measurement</b>.
      Information on each individual source measurement. 34,658,213,888 rows.<br>

</ul>
