    <h2>Data Reduction</h2>
</header>
As described on the <a href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/the-des-project/survey-and-operations/">DES web page</a>, the DES data are processed through the DES Data Management (DESDM) pipeline, which includes image detrending and photometry.  The photometry is performed with modified versions of the <a href="https://www.astromatic.net">Astromatic</a> software suite, in particular the SExtractor and PSFEx packages.  Users of these packages will find many of the column names in the DES DR1 tables to be familiar.
