    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
</header>
The NSC data processing makes use of three separate software packages: (1) the
<a href="http://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/fvaldes/CPDocPrelim/PL201_3.html">Community
Pipeline (CP)</a> for instrument signature removal (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ASPC..485..379V">
Valdes et al. 2014</a>),
(2) <a href="https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor">Source Extractor</a>
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996A%26AS..117..393B">Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996</a>) for performing
source extraction from the images, and (3)
<a href="https://github.com/noaodatalab/noaosourcecatalog">custom software</a> (in python and IDL)
to run SExtractor on the images and to perform calibration and combination.

<ul>
    <li><b>Reduction</b>.
      All of the images were reduced by the NOAO Community Pipeline.
      The instrumentally calibrated ("InstCal") images with the instrumental signature removed
      were used for further analysis to create the NSC catalogs.
    </li>
    <li><b>Measurement</b>.
      Source Extractor was run on each individual chip image to extract aperture photometry and
      morphological parameters.  The SExtractor configuration parameters are available 
      <a href="overview/default.config">here</a> and were modified slightly for each image
      (seeing, gain, saturation level and circular aperture sizes).
      In the future, we plan to perform PSF photometry on individual exposures and stacked images.
    </li>
    <li><b>Calibration</b>.

      The zero-point for each exposure was obtained by using publicly available catalogs.  For
      grizY exposures above -29 degrees declination the <a href="https://panstarrs.stsci.edu">Pan-STARRS1 DR1</a>
      catalog was used. For the soutern exposures in griz bands, zeropoints were derived using
      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...867..105T/abstract">ATLAS-Refcat2</a> stars. For
      u-band exposures below 0 degree declination, zeropoints were derived using
      <a href="http://skymapper.anu.edu.au/data-release/dr1/">Skymapper DR1</a>.  VR-band exposures were calibrated
      using the average of the r-band (PS1 in the north and ATLAS-Refcat2 in the south) and
      <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr2">Gaia DR2</a> G magnitudes.  Finally, model magnitudes
      were used for u-band exposures with positive declinations using
      <a href="http://www.galex.caltech.edu/about/overview.html">GALEX</a>, Gaia DR2 and
      <a href="https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/">2MASS</a> photometry, and for Y-band exposures with
      declinations below -29 deg using 2MASS photometry.  Extinction values to construct dereddened colors
      were calculated using the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...500..525S">Schlegel, Finkbeiner &amp; David (1998)</a>
      reddening map and RJCE method (Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess,
      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...739...25M/abstract">Majewski et al. 2011</a>), using
      2MASS, <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/sirtf/">Spitzer</a> and
      <a href="https://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/">WISE</a> infrared photometry, in higher extinction regions.
																			
      The astrometry of each chip (the WCS) was calibrated using the Gaia DR2 catalog and corrections for proper motion to the
      epoch of the observation.
    </li>
    <li><b>Combination</b>.
      Quality cuts were used to remove exposures with poor seeing, bad zero-points, large spatial
      variations in the zero-point, or poor astrometric calibration.  Furthermore, quality cuts were
      also applied to the individual source meaurements that were affected by bad pixels,
      truncated at the edge, or had low signal-to-noise (S/N&lt;5).  Finally, measurements from multiple
      overlapping exposures were combined on a <a href="https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> (nside=128) pixel basis.
      The grouping algorithm of measurements into objects was substantially upgraded in DR2 to better handle faster moving
      stars and more robustly measure proper motions.  First, the NSC DR2 measurements in a single HEALPix were clustered
      using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN">DBSCAN</a> with a clustering distance of 0.4 seconds to create
      object "seeds".  Second, any remaining measurements
      were crossmatched to the seeds using a radius of three times their astrometric uncertainty.  The second step is needed
      because DBSCAN does not take positional uncertainties into account.  Average magnitudes and morphological
      parameters (in each band), proper motions, and photometric variability metrics were then computed for each object.
