    <h2>Data Reduction</h2>

The DES data are processed through the DES Data Management (DESDM) pipeline, which includes image detrending and photometry (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASP..130g4501M">Morganson et al. 2018</a>).  The photometry is performed with modified versions of the <a href="https://www.astromatic.net">Astromatic</a> software suite, in particular the SExtractor and PSFEx packages.  Users of these packages will find many of the column names in the DES tables to be familiar.
