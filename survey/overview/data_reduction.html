Each subcomponent of DELVE uses slightly different data reduction pipelines.

<ul>
    <li><b>DELVE-WIDE: </b>
      The DELVE WIDE data are processed with the DES Data Management (DESDM) pipeline (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03177">Morganson et al. 2018</a>). 
      SourceExtractor is used to create catalogs from the reduced ("FinalCut") images.
      Astrometric calibration is performed against Gaia DR2 and photometric calibration is performed against ATLAS Refcat2 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09157">Tonry et al. 2018</a>).
      Currently, the best references for the DELVE-WIDE processing are: DESDM (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03177">Morganson et al. 2018</a>), catalog creation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03622">Drlica-Wagner et al. 2015</a>), calibration and validation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08550">Cerny et al. 2020</a>)
    </li>
    <li><b>DELVE-MC: </b>.
      The DELVE-MC images are reduced with the DECam Community Pipeline (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ASPC..485..379V">Valdes et al. 2014</a>), which is based on an early versions of the DESDM pipeline.
      The DELVE-MC processing is performed using DELVERED, a modified version of the <code>DAOPhot</code>-based <a href="https://github.com/dnidever/PHOTRED">PHOTRED</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00502">Nidever et al. 2017</a>), an automated and robust PSF photometry pipeline based on the DAOPHOT suite of programs (Stetson 1987, 1994).
      Astrometric calibration is performed against Gaia DR2 and photometric calibration is performed against ATLAS Refcat2 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09157"Tonry et al. 2018</a>).
      The best current reference for the DELVE-MC processing is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00502">Nidever et al. (2017)</a>.
    </li>
    <li><b>DELVE-DEEP: </b>.
      The DELVE Collaboration is currently exploring various options for processing the DELVE-DEEP data.
      To date, the DELVE-DEEP data have been processed by both the DESDM pipeline for image coaddition and the <code>DELVERED</code> pipeline for crowded-field photometry.
