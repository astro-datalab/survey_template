    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
</header>
The NSC data processing makes use of three separate software packages: (1) the
<a href="http://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/fvaldes/CPDocPrelim/PL201_3.html">Community
Pipeline (CP)</a> for instrument signature removal (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ASPC..485..379V">
Valdes et al. 2014</a>),
(2) <a href="https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor">Source Extractor</a>
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996A%26AS..117..393B">Bertin &amp; Arnouts 1996</a>) for performing
source extraction from the images, and (3)
<a href="https://github.com/dnidever/noaosourcecatalog">custom software</a> (in python and IDL)
to run SExtractor on the images and to perform calibration and combination.

<ul>
    <li><b>Reduction</b>.
      All of the images were reduced by the NOAO Community Pipeline.
      The instrumentally calibrated ("InstCal") images with the instrumental signature removed
      were used for further analysis to create the NSC catalogs.
    </li>
    <li><b>Measurement</b>.
      Source Extractor was run on each individual chip image to extract aperture photometry and
      morphological parameters.  The SExtractor configuration parameters are available 
      <a href="overview/default.config">here</a> and were modified slightly for each image
      (seeing, gain, saturation level and circular aperture sizes).
      In the future, we plan to perform PSF photometry on individual exposures and stacked images.
    </li>
    <li><b>Calibration</b>.
      The zero-point for each exposure was obtained by using publicly available catalogs.  For
      grizY exposures above -30 degrees declination the <a href="https://panstarrs.stsci.edu">Pan-STARRS1 DR1</a>
      catalog was used.  For the rest of the exposures, model magnitudes were constructed from
      <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1">Gaia DR1</a>,
      <a href="https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/">2MASS</a>,
      <a href="http://www.galex.caltech.edu/about/overview.html">GALEX</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.aavso.org/apass">APASS</a> and an extinction term using the
      <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...500..525S">Schlegel, Finkbeiner &amp; David (1998)</a> reddening map.
      The astrometry of each chip was calibrated using the Gaia DR1 catalog.
    </li>
    <li><b>Combination</b>.
      Quality cuts were used to remove exposures with poor seeing, bad zero-points, large spatial
      variations in the zero-point, or poor astrometric calibration.  Furthermore, quality cuts were
      also applied to the individual source meaurements that were affected by bad pixels,
      truncated at the edge, or had low signal-to-noise (S/N&lt;5).  Finally, measurements from multiple
      overlapping exposures were combined on a healpix (nside=128) pixel basis.  Sources were crossmatched
      and their average magnitudes and morphological parameters (in each band) were computed.  Finally, proper motions
      and the photometric variability in each band were also calculated.
