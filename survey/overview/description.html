            The DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) Survey seeks to understand the faintest and most dark-matter-dominated galaxies.
            DELVE is a deep, multi-component survey using DECam on the 4-meter Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile.
            DELVE will combine existing DECam data with 126 nights of novel observations to enable dwarf galaxy detection detection over a broad range of luminosity, from the faintest dwarf spheroidal galaxies (L ~ 10<sup>3</sup>L<sub>&#8857;</sub>) to analogs of the Large Magellanic Cloud (L ~ 10<sup>9−10</sup>L<sub>&#8857;</sub>), in diverse environments throughout the Local Volume.
            DELVE consists of:
            <ul>
            <li> WIDE: a high-Galactic-latitude wide-area survey of 10,500 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of g ~ 23.5. </li>
            <li> MC: a contiguous Magellanic Cloud periphery survey of 1,000 deg<sup>2</sup> at a depth of g ~ 24.2. </li>
            <li> DEEP: a deep targeted survey of 200 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of i ~ 25.0 around several isolated Local Volume dwarf galaxies.</li>
            </ul>
            These three components will provide complementary insights into the abundance and properties of dwarf galaxies around hosts at different mass scales and in a variety of environments. 
            Combined with a unified theoretical framework, DELVE will enable exploration of the dependence of satellite properties on effects of reionization, host halo properties, and environment, offering essential insights into the galaxy–halo connection.

              <p align="justify">Local Group dwarf galaxies span more than a factor of a million in stellar mass and brightness. 
By imaging the entire southern sky, DELVE will allow us to find the faintest Milky Way satellites out to distances of ~50 kpc. These galaxies are important probes of dark matter physics and galaxy formation.<br>

            <p>The standard model of cosmology predicts that galaxies like our Milky Way inhabit large dark matter halos, which grow hierarchically by merging with and/or accreting smaller galaxies. There is ample evidence for this hierarchical paradigm on large scales, but small-scale tests are challenging due to the low luminosities of the faintest galaxies. Our Milky Way and its surrounding population of satellite galaxies offer a unique opportunity to study fundamental physics of dark matter and galaxy formation. The DELVE WIDE program will complete DECam coverage over the entire southern sky to address these fundamental questions in near-field cosmology.</p>

<p>DECam has played a pivotal role in expanding the known population of ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxies. 
The demographics of ultra-faint dwarf satellite galaxies are sensitive to the particle properties of dark matter and to the physics of galaxy formation. 
One striking aspect of the DECam discoveries is the concentration of ultra-faint satellites in the vicinity of the Magellanic Clouds. This has reinvigorated the hypothesis that the MCs brought their own population of dwarf companions, and has provided an exciting opportunity to study the impact of environment on low-mass galaxies. DELVE WIDE will complete DECam multi-band imaging over the southern sky, and we expect to detect ~10 new satellites based on hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations.</p>

<p>When satellites of the Milky Way stray too close they can be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the Milky way creating long, thin streams of stars. 
Stellar streams are difficult to detect due to their low surface brightness (~32 mag/arcsec<sup>2</sup>) and large extent on the sky (~10s of degrees). The contiguous,  uniform coverage of DELVE will extend the search for stellar streams beyond the DES footprint. The fraction of stars contained within currently visible substructures and the morphology and composition of debris structures will tell us about the recent accretion history of the Milky Way, including the masses, orbits, and metallicities of recently accreted satellites. Stellar streams also probe both the large- and small-scale distribution of dark matter around the Milky Way: they trace the gravitational potential of the Milky Way over a large range of radii and offer a promising technique to test the existence of dark matter substructure below the threshold of galaxy formation.</p>
