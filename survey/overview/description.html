<p> The unWISE Catalog is a deep, deblended catalog of sources from the
  <a href="http://unwise.me">unWISE</a> coadds of the
  <a href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/wise.html">WISE images</a>, covering the entire
  sky at 3.4 and 4.6 microns. The unWISE coadds
  (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190905444M/abstract">Meisner et al. 2019</a>)
  include the images from the <a href="https://neowise.ipac.caltech.edu/">NEOWISE</a>
  phase of the
  WISE mission, giving them five times the exposure time of the coadds
  from the initial WISE survey.
  The unWISE Catalog contains more than two billion sources from these coadds.</p>
<p> The WISE point spread function has a full-width at half-maximum of about 6"
  in the W1 and W2 bands used for NEOWISE, which
  coupled with the large number of sources detected in the deep WISE imaging means
  that most sources overlap with other sources in the images.  To accurately model
  the photometry of these blended sources, the unWISE team uses the
  <a href="http://github.com/schlafly/crowdsource">crowdsource</a> analysis pipeline
  (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..234...39S/abstract">Schlafly et al. 2018</a>)
  to simultaneously determine the positions and fluxes of all sources in the unWISE coadds.</p>
<p> The greater depth of the unWISE coadds relative to coadds from the first year of
  the WISE survey, combined with the crowdsource crowded-field modeling, allows the unWISE
  team to measure fluxes for roughly three times as many sources as were detected
  in the AllWISE catalog.</p>
