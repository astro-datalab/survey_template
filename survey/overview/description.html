  <h2>NOAO Source Catalog (NSC) - Description</h2>
</header>

<p>The NOAO Source Catalog (NSC) is a catalog of nearly all of the public imaging data in NOAO's archive.  These images
  from telescopes in both hemispheres nearly cover the entire sky.
  While the large majority of these data were obtained for PI-led projects, only a fraction have been released
  to the community via well-calibrated and easily accessible catalogs.   The NSC remedies this situation by creating a
  catalog of sources from most of the public data taken on CTIO-4m+DECam as well as KPNO-4m+Mosaic3 and some from
  the Bok-2.3+90Prime.  The first NSC public data release (DR1) contains over 2.9 billion unique objects, 34 billion
  individual source measurements, covers ~30,000 square degrees of the sky, has 10-sigma depths of ~23rd magnitude in most
  broadband filters, and an astrometric accuracy of ~2 mas.  The NSC will be useful for exploring stellar streams,
  dwarf satellite galaxies, as well as variable stars and other transients.  Browse these pages to learn more about the NSC and how to access the data.
  The NSC DR1 overview paper (<a href="nscdr1_overview.pdf">Nidever et al. 2018</a>) describes the catalog in detail,
  including its the source extraction, calibration, combination, quality assurance, and science use cases.
