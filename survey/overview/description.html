<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a 5000 square degree survey of the Southern sky in <i>grizY</i> aimed at understanding the accelerating expansion of the Universe and the nature of dark energy.  DES uses four complementary measurements to probe the evolution of the Universe:  weak gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster counts, the large-scale clustering of galaxies (including baryon acoustic oscillations), and the distances to type Ia supernovae. DES uses the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 570 Megapixel CCD imaging camera with a 3 square degree field of view installed at the prime focus of on the Blanco 4m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in northern Chile.  DES observed for a period of six years (2013-2019), and has collected information from roughly 550 million distant galaxies and 150 million Milky Way stars.  DES has also performed a 27 square degree time domain survey aimed at discovering thousands of supernova and other transients.  The <a href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">DES webpage</a> contains a full description of the survey.
