The DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey (DELVE) combines archival DECam data with 126 nights of novel observations to study dwarf satellite galaxies over a broad range of luminosities and environments. 
DELVE is divided into three survey components (WIDE, MC, and DEEP), which each have their own observational and processing strategy.
By the end of the survey, DELVE is expected to cover 10,500 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of g,r,i,z ~ 23.5 mag, 1,050 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of g,r,i ~ 24.5 mag, and 150 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of g,i ~ 25.5 mag.
When combined with existing data from DES, DECaLS, and other community programs, DELVE will provide complete contiguous DECam coverage of the entire high-Galactic-latitude southern sky.
