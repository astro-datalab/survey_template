<p>
The DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) Survey combines existing archival DECam data with 126 nights of novel observations to study dwarf satellite galaxies over a broad range of luminosity. 
DELVE is divided into three survey components (WIDE, MC, and DEEP), which each have their own observational and processing strategy.
By the end of the survey, DELVE is expected to cover 10,500 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of griz ~ 23.5 mag, 1,050 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of gri ~ 24.5 mag, and 150 deg<sup>2</sup> to a depth of gi ~ 25.5 mag.
The DELVE DR1 data release is limited to the WIDE survey, described below.
