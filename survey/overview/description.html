  <h2>NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC) DR2 - Description</h2>
</header>

<p>The NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC) is a catalog of nearly all of the public imaging data in
  <a href="https://astroarchive.noao.edu/">NOIRLab's Astro Data Archive</a>.  These images
  from telescopes in both hemispheres nearly cover the entire sky.
  While the large majority of these data were obtained for PI-led projects, only a fraction have been released
  to the community via well-calibrated and easily accessible catalogs.   The NSC remedies this situation by creating a
  catalog of sources from most of the public data taken on CTIO-4m+DECam as well as KPNO-4m+Mosaic3 and some from
  the Bok-2.3+90Prime.  The second NSC public data release (DR2) contains over 3.9 billion unique objects, 68 billion
  individual source measurements, covers ~35,000 square degrees of the sky, has depths of ~23rd magnitude in most
  broadband filters with ~1-2% photometry, accurate proper motions, and an astrometric accuracy of ~2 mas.
  The NSC will be useful for exploring stellar streams, dwarf satellite galaxies, variable stars, hight proper
  otion objects, QSO variability, and transients.  Browse these pages to learn more about NSC DR2 and how to access the data.
  The NSC DR2 paper (<a href="nscdr2.pdf">Nidever et al. 2020</a>) describes the catalog in detail,
  including the source extraction, calibration, combination, quality assurance, and science use cases.  Also, see
  <a href="nscdr1_overview.pdf">Nidever et al. 2018</a> for NSC DR1 information.
